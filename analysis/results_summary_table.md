**Project Title:** An Empirical Framework for Algorithmic Optimization and Predictive Data-Fetching in Full-Stack Web Applications  
**Proposer:** Jarin Tasnim  
**Sample Size:** N=30 test runs per scenario (180 total experimental runs)

## Notes on interpretation
These rows are SIMULATED outputs of the benchmark model (run_synthetic_benchmark.js / Benchmark Cockpit), not browser measurements. For measured results run `npm run benchmark:browser` and `npm run analyze:browser`.
- **Broadband**: modelled mean latency reduction 44.18%, Optimised median 6.22 ms, modelled extra requests +13.3%, Welch p = 5.85e-05 (computed).
- **Fast 4G**: modelled mean latency reduction 71.95%, Optimised median 5.44 ms, modelled extra requests +13.3%, Welch p = 5.43e-11 (computed).
- **Throttled 3G**: modelled mean latency reduction 62.29%, Optimised median 5.21 ms, modelled extra requests +20.0%, Welch p = 1.26e-07 (computed).
